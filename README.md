## Layered Architecture
We use the layered architecture for this RESTful API, these consist of the following:

1. **Controllers**: These are the routes that are the entry points into the business logic
2. **Service**: This is where the business logic will sit for the program
3. **Repository**: This is where the database queries are made
4. **Model**: This will be the defined schemas for the models
